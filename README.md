# Put title of your app here

## :scroll: Description

Here is AdoptMe, the Online Dogs Shelter Android application.

You can find here our dogs for adoption with their names, breed, main characteristics, and a message they want to share
with you.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

It was the first application I did in Compose and even if I struggle with the layouts I ended up with something simple
but catchy.

I like the dogs' avatar in the list and how the chips are moved to the right.

Dark mode is also looking good but what I most proud of is the lovely messages from the dogs.
